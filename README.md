Allow WooCommerce inventory stock to be reduced when adding items to cart and/or expire items from the cart

## Description ##

[WooCommerce](http://www.woothemes.com/woocommerce/) doesn't remove an item from inventory until someone actually buys
that item.  This plugin can reduce the "virtual" stock quantity of an item without actually modifying the item
inventory, so there should be no problems with missing data if somehow the cart data is deleted.  This plugin isn't for
everyone, but people that are selling specialty items will find it useful and hopefully eliminate some customer
support nightmares.

The plugin can automatically expire items from the cart (disabled by default) with a configurable expiration time.
Expiration times are plain english using whatever types php's strtotime can support (Examples: 10 minutes, 1 hour, 6 hours, 1 day)
Per item expiration time can be configured by adding a Custom Field to each item using the configured
'Expire Custom Key' (default name is 'csr_expire_time').

Expiration can be enabled independently of reducing the cart stock, so this plugin can also be used to expire items at
other intervals than the default WooCommerce cart/session expiration.

An issue was opened on the [WooCommerce issue tracker](https://github.com/woothemes/woocommerce/issues/5966) regarding
this problem and someone posted on Facebook about it, which caught my attention.

## Frequently Asked Questions ##

### What happens if two users click the add to cart at the same time? ###

The first request that hits the server will get the item if there is only one available.  The other person will receive
a "Item is no longer available" message.

### What happens if someone tries to increase the quantity from their shopping cart and that amount is unavailable? ###

They will receive a "Quantity requested not available" message and their original quantity will be retained.

### What setting should I use for 'Minimum Stock to Skip Check'? ###

You can set this by using the 'wc_csr_min_no_check' filter.  This is an advanced option and should only be used on high
volume sites with predictable orders.  The setting to use depends on your stock quantites and how much you expect to
sell.  If you have a stock of 100 and only expect to sell 10 per hour you could set this to 25 and set the expiration
to one hour and you should be safe. Always err on the side of caution, you don't want to run out of stock when someone
believes they will get an item.  If in doubt, don't use this option.

### What adjustments need to be made to caching? ###

We recommend turning off page and database caching for pages affected by this plugin. For example, assuming your site 
uses the default Woocommerce "shop" page and W3 Total Cache, add "shop/*" (without the quotes) to "Never cache the 
following pages:" at the page cache and database cache settings.

### Does this plugin work with Suhosin? ###

Yes it does, but the default character length (64) for POST/REQUEST variable names is not sufficient. I suggest following
the recomendations from WooCommerce and increasing these values. For more information:
