Allow WooCommerce inventory stock to be reduced when adding items to cart

== Description ==

[WooCommerce](http://www.woothemes.com/woocommerce/) doesn't remove an item from inventory until someone actually buys
that item.  This plugin will reduce the "virtual" stock quantity of an item without actually modifying the item
inventory, so there should be no problems with missing data if somehow the cart data is deleted.  This plugin isn't for
everyone, but people that are selling specialty items will find it useful and hopefully eliminate some customer
support nightmares.

Currently the system will expire carts normally unless there is another plugin installed.  I have some thoughts on how
to make a softer expiration work, if you are interested in this send me a note.

An issue was opened on the [WooCommerce issue tracker](https://github.com/woothemes/woocommerce/issues/5966) regarding
this problem and someone posted on Facebook about it, which caught my attention.

Please submit bug reports, feature requests, and pull requests via the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/jamesgol/woocommerce-cart-stock-reducer)

== Installation ==

1. Upload plugin and activate through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What happens if two users click the add to cart at the same time? =

The first request that hits the server will get the item if there is only one available.  The other person will receive
a "Item is no longer available" message.

= What happens if someone tries to increase the quantity from their shopping cart and that amount is unavailable? =

They will receive a "Quantity requested not available" message and their original quantity will be retained.
